A library issues loan items to customers.Each customer is
konwn as a member and is issued a membership card that shows a unique
member number. Details about customer are the membership number ,a name, address, and date of birth.
The library is made up of a number of subject sections.
Each section is described by a classification mark. A loan item is uniquely
identified by a bar code.
There are two types of loan items, language tapes and books. A language tape
has a title language (e.g. French), and level (e.g.beginner).
A book has  title, author. A customer may borrow up to a maximum of 8
items at one time.
An item can be borrowed, reserved or renewed to extend a current loan. When
an item is issued the customer's membership number
is scanned via a bar code reader or entered manually. If the membership is still
valid and the number of loan items
less than 8, the book bar code is read, either via the bar code reader or entered
manually. If the item can be
issued (e.g. not reserved) the item is stamped and then issued. The library must
support the facility for an item to be searched and for a daily update of records.
